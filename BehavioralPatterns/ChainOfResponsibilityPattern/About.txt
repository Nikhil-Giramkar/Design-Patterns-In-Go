Chain of Responsibility is behavioral design pattern that 
allows passing request along the chain of potential handlers until one of them handles request.

Here, Whenever any patient arrives, 
they first get to Reception, 
then to Doctor, 
then to Medicine Room, 
and then to Cashier (and so on). 
The patient is being sent through a chain of departments, 
where each department sends the patient further down the chain once their function is completed.

Useful case is when you want to decouple the client from receiversâ€”
the client will only need to know the first element in the chain.

Its just like Middlewares which process one after the other...
