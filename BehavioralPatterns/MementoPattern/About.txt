Memento is a behavioral design pattern 
that allows making snapshots of an object’s state and restoring it in future.

The Memento doesn’t compromise the internal structure of the object it works with, 
as well as data kept inside the snapshots.

Here, we took the real-world example of Virtual Machines
Where VM is the originator and contains current state

Snapshots are Memento which are saved time to time in SnapshotManager

We can restore any snapshot and override the current state of VM
