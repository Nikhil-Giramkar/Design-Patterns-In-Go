# Design-Patterns-In-Go
<p>
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
</p>

<p>
Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. Even if you never encounter these problems, knowing patterns is still useful because it teaches you how to solve all sorts of problems using principles of object-oriented design.

Design Patterns can be classified in 3 sections
<li>
<b>Creational patterns</b> provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
</li>

<li>
<b>Structural patterns</b> explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
</li>

<li>
<b>Behavioral patterns</b> take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
</li>

<ol>
<li> Factory Pattern </li>
<li> Abstract Factory Pattern </li>
<li> Singleton Pattern </li>
<li> Builder Pattern </li>
<li> Prototype Pattern </li>
</ol>
</li>

<li> 
<b>Structural Pattern</b>
<ol>
<li> Adapter Pattern </li>
<li> Decorator Factory Pattern </li>
<li> Composite Pattern </li>

## How to run
Open the last folder in folder structure in terminal <br>
Example:
```
   cd BehavioralPatterns\MementoPattern
```
Then run the command: 
```
  go run .
```
You will see the output in terminal.
