Factory Pattern
----------------

Factory method is a creational design pattern 
which solves the problem of creating product objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.

Problem
--------
Imagine you have a weapon factory.
Initially, you build only AK 47 in your factory.
So all the required code for creating a Gun is inside AK-47 struct.

But now, the company grows, and you get orders to create different guns
Like M16.

But now your entire code for creating a Gun is inside AK-47.
In this case, you need to shift the entire codebase now.
And suppose in future you get orders for another Gun type, lets say Pistol
Then shifting codebases.
Writing redundant code will be unmanageable.

solution
--------
As a solution, create a single struct/ class
Gun, which will have common methods for creating all sorts of Guns.
This Gun can be derived to create different Guns.
