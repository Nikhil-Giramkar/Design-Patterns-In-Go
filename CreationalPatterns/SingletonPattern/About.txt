Just like a global variable, 
the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. 
However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.

Example
---------
In our app, we might have multiple features.
Each feature has to perform some action on Database.
So instead of creating seperate instances of DB for each feature.
We can create a single instance and use it across the application.
