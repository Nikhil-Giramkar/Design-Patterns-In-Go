Decorator is a structural pattern that allows 
adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them 
inside special wrapper objects, called decorators.

In this example,
We have base pizza.
We can wrap it in other structs to get additional properties like
Base + Tomato
Base + Tomato + Cheese
Base + Cheese
By wrapping them inside other decorators.

It makes very re-usable code as we are just adding wrappers around existing objects.
